Char's Modpack for Minecraft V1.20.2
This modpack uses the fabric installer!
You can support the official website.
Here: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/
(This is included in the zip file.) If you would like the older 0.11.2 version it would be found.
Here: https://maven2.fabricmc.net/net/fabricmc/fabric-installer/0.11.2/
The files also work server side. I will be making a separate installer/project for that.
(Projects can take a while, Thank you for your patience and understanding.)
